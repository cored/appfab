## Kanban, one level up: agility at the product level.

> AppFab helps software product teams build fanstastic apps, by encouraging
> contribution, transparency, participative planning, and emergent
> prioritisation of projects.

It works great for small teams with external stakeholders,  or larger teams
(ours is 25 people).

Its goal is not to replace day-to-day tools like Kanbanery or Pivotal
Tracker, but rather a means to let the collective pitch ideas, priorise them
through voting, and follow them through their whole lifecycle.


### Usage

Go to [appfab.io](http://appfab.io/) and create your account. Signup is free
and the app is pretty self-explanatory.

As the app is in beta, the hosted version is free for all but aboslutely no
SLA or guarantee of customer support is provided.
