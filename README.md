# AppFab

This app aims to let teams manage a product in a participative, social way.

Its goal is not to replace day-to-day tools like Kanbanery or Pivotal Tracker, but rather a means to let the collective pitch ideas, priorise them through voting, and follow them through their whole lifecycle.


### Usage

Go to http://appfab.io/ and create your account. Signup is free and the app is pretty self-explanatory.


### Licence

AppFab is open source but it's *not* free software.

Its source code is made available to the public under a modified version of the [AGPL 3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html) licence, with:

- restrictions to performing the software or any derivative thereof, and
- legally binding abandonnement of copyright for all contributors.

If you plan to contribute to AppFab, please have a read at LICENCE.md in this repository.

This licencing scheme is meant to enable AppFab to remain open source without risking facing any legal challenge for contributors (or their employers), and enabling the author to provide an affordable hosted version of the application.

### Trademark

While neither "AppFab" text mark nor the appfab logo (boldface black letter
"a" on white background) are currently registered in any country, the author
hereby claims both in the context of NICE categories 9; 38; 41; and 42.

If trademarks mean nothing to you, this is intended to protect the name
"AppFab" and set precedent to avoid trademark squatting and bullying from
trademark trolls.
