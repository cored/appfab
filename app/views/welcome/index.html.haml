      Gather brilliant ideas
    %p
      Ever been to the pub with your team? They're frustrated because they know what the users want. They're bursting with ideas for new features and know the really painful bug... but lack the avenue to express themselves.
    %p
      So throw that old "ideas box" awayâ€”be it an online form or a real-world box. Time to let the team pitch their ideas and defend them.
